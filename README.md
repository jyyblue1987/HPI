The final product will be a client-side (just front-end) application created using ReactJS. The application will be what is called a content generator, in which it has a form on the left side and on the right side it will show the final generated content.
Each form field on the left side is responsible for a specific part of the content, so when user clicks from available options of each field, they will get the content generated on the right side.
